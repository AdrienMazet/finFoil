LICENSE
=======
The majority of the code is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.
However, parts of the code are licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1.
Since Everything is statically linked, the total project inherits the LGPL license.
It should be trivial for every Qt/C++ programmer to extract this code for dynamic linking so that a BSD licensed project is obtained with a dynamic dependency on a LGPL library.

You should have received a copy of the licence agreement for both the 2-clause BSD license and the LGPLv2 license along with this source code bundle.
