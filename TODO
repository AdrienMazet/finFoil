* Probably best to remove locking from EditablePath and put in ThicknessContours where multithreading will happen

General TODO's
==============

* Cleanup unused includes
* Forward declaration of classes (instead of includes in header files) to speedup compilation
* Add documentation comments


Improvements with C++11
=======================

* Native strong typed enums (now in structs)
