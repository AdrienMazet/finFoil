# finFoil v1.1 roadmap update

At the time of writing, v1.1 is almost ready for release. Unfortunately, the finbases feature won't make it in the v1.1 release and is postponed for a later update. However, some unannounced features were added. For example, v1.1 makes it possible to import and export profiles and thickness profiles independently to reuse them easily in other designs. Another nice addition is that it will be possible to export STL files from within the desktop application, without the need to open your web browser.<br/>
Your patience will be rewarded!

Happy fin building!
Hans.
