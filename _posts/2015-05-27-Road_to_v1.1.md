We're on the road to finFoil v1.1!

Using [finFoil-web](http://hrobeers.github.io/finfoil-web/), [these finbases](https://github.com/hrobeers/finbases) and [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), it's already possible to create files like the one shown below. With the arrival of v1.1, this functionality will become available at the click of a button.

Step by step [this list of features](https://github.com/hrobeers/finFoil/milestones/v1.1.0) will be implemented to result in v1.1. So now is the time to raise the issues you are facing with the current version. Contact us trough [Twitter](https://twitter.com/finfoil) or [Github](https://github.com/hrobeers/finFoil).

To make sure your finbases are included for 3D export, please contribute to [the finbases project](https://github.com/hrobeers/finbases).

It will become easier than ever to get your fins routed or 3D printed.
Now is the time to start experimenting!
